**other considerations**

work Content per Region/IC:

"There might be more reconditioning work required from certain cars in certain regions (e.g., cars in the northeast typically require more paint because of snow).  To optimize where we recon the car, youâ€™d want to net the additional cost of buying/recon a car in the northeast vs. doing it in DC area and paying to transport the car to the northeast"
